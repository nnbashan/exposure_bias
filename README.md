This study integrates high-resolution human mobility data from smartphone-based travel surveys with calibrated PM2.5 measurements from a network of low-cost air quality sensors to quantify air pollution exposure biases across the Boston Metropolitan Area, Massachusetts, USA. Analyzing 155,000 trip records from 990 residents collected between June and December 2023, we demonstrate that conventional residence-based exposure assessment methods systematically underestimate actual exposures by an average of 0.1 µg/m³ compared to those derived from daily mobility patterns, with differences reaching up to 0.45 µg/m³ on high-pollution days. These disparities vary significantly (up to 0.12 µg/m³) across different sociodemographic categories, with employed individuals experiencing the largest discrepancies between mobility-based and residence-based exposure estimates. We identified spatial variations in exposure up to 1.0 µg/m³ across different ZIP codes and observed temporal variations of up to 0.3 µg/m³ among different sociodemographic groups. We found that air pollution exposure disparities are influenced by complex interactions between residential location, mobility patterns, and the timing of travel, which cannot be captured by traditional residential-only assessments. These results have important implications for environmental justice initiatives, health impact assessments, and targeted interventions to mitigate exposure disparities in urban environments.
